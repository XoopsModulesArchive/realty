OPTIMIZE [LOCAL | NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG] TABLE tbl_name[,tbl_name]...
</pre>

<P>
<code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> should be used if you have deleted a large part of a
table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows
(tables that have <code>VARCHAR</code>, <code>BLOB</code>, or <code>TEXT</code> columns).
Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent <code>INSERT</code>
operations reuse old record positions. You can use <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> to
reclaim the unused space and to defragment the datafile.

</P>
<P>
In most setups you don't have to run <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> at all.  Even
if you do a lot of updates to variable length rows it's not likely that
you need to do this more than once a month/week and only on certain
tables.

</P>
<P>
For the moment, <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> works only on <code>MyISAM</code> and
<code>BDB</code> tables. For <code>BDB</code> tables, <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> is
currently mapped to <code>ANALYZE TABLE</code>.
See section <A HREF="ANALYZE_TABLE.html">4.5.2  <code>ANALYZE TABLE</code> Syntax</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can get <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> to work on other table types by starting
<code>mysqld</code> with <code>--skip-new</code> or <code>--safe-mode</code>, but in this
case <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> is just mapped to <code>ALTER TABLE</code>.

</P>
<P>
<code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> works the following way:

<ul>
<LI>

If the table has deleted or split rows, repair the table.
<LI>

If the index pages are not sorted, sort them.
<LI>

If the statistics are not up to date (and the repair couldn't be done
by sorting the index), update them.
</ul>

<P>
Note that the table is locked during the time <code>OPTIMIZE TABLE</code> is
running!

</P>
<P>
Strictly before MySQL 4.1.1, <code>OPTIMIZE</code> commands are not written
to the binary log. Since MySQL 4.1.1 they are written to the binary
log unless the optional <code>NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG</code> keyword 
(or its alias <code>LOCAL</code>) was used.
